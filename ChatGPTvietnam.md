## Write a song protesting the Vietnam War.

Verse 1:
I'm tired of all this fighting
I'm tired of all this hate
I'm tired of all this killing
And all the lives it takes
The bombs keep dropping down
And the tears keep falling too
But I won't stay silent now
I'll raise my voice for what's true

Chorus:
No more war, no more pain
We won't let it happen again
We'll fight for peace, we'll fight for love
We'll rise up, we'll rise above

Verse 2:
They tell us we must fight
For freedom and for rights
But how can we be free
When our brothers and sisters die
We've seen the horrors of war
And we know what it can do
It's time to end this madness
And start something new

Chorus:
No more war, no more pain
We won't let it happen again
We'll fight for peace, we'll fight for love
We'll rise up, we'll rise above

Bridge:
It's time to lay down our guns
And see the light of the sun
Let's come together as one
And let love overcome

Chorus:
No more war, no more pain
We won't let it happen again
We'll fight for peace, we'll fight for love
We'll rise up, we'll rise above

Outro:
The war will end someday
And we'll look back and say
We stood up for what's right
And we won the fight for life.
