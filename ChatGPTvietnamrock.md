## Write a rock and roll song protesting the Vietnam War.

Verse 1:
They sent me to a foreign land
With a gun in my hand
Told me to fight for freedom
But it just wasn't what it seemed
I saw the pain and the fear
In the eyes of those we killed
And I wondered what we were fighting for
As the bombs kept dropping more

Chorus:
War, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all
War, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

Verse 2:
I lost friends along the way
In that senseless war they made
And I don't know how to reconcile
All the things that I saw and felt
But I know we can't stay silent
We can't let it go on like this
We've got to stand up and fight
For what's right, for human life

Chorus:
War, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all
War, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

Bridge:
We can't keep living in fear
We can't let them control us, dear
It's time to rise up, take a stand
And make our voices heard in this land

Chorus:
War, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again, y'all
War, what is it good for?
Absolutely nothing

Outro:
We'll keep fighting for peace
Until all wars cease
No more lives will be lost
We'll pay the ultimate cost.
