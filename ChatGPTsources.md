## Can ChatGPT credit sources?
ChatGPT itself does not have the ability to credit sources. However, it can be programmed to include references or citations to specific sources of information. For example, if a user inputs a question about a specific topic and the response generated by ChatGPT includes information from a particular source, the output can be designed to include a citation or a link to the original source.

However, it's important to note that the responsibility for proper citation and referencing ultimately falls on the user. ChatGPT is a tool that can be used to generate ideas and information, but it cannot replace the need for students to learn how to properly cite their sources and avoid plagiarism. It's essential to teach students how to properly credit sources and to encourage them to take ownership of their work by verifying the accuracy of the information they use in their assignments.
